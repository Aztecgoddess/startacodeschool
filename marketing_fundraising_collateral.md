#### Introduction
First impressions matter. For most people, your website or pitch deck will shape their perception of your organization’s effectiveness, its values, and ultimately their willingness to support you. But with dozens of unread emails, an ever-growing to-do list, and day-to-day operational challenges it can be hard to give a website or pitch deck the attention it deserves. In this section I’ll share some resources I’ve used to design websites and pitch decks in hours, not days.

#### Website

My first recommendation may offend you front-end wizards out there, but here it goes anyway: don’t code your own website; use a website builder like Squarespace (note: this is not a paid endorsement). In the “less is more” ethos of this book I’ll argue my point in three bullets:

- Unless you’re a designer, Squarespace’s templates will offer a better designed website. You get to take advantage of website design that cost them tens of thousands of dollars for $8 / mo.

- Getting a simple landing page up that will get you through the first semester will take less than two hours. All you have to do is find a template, edit the copy and upload some photos.

- When you delegate the website management to a volunteer you don’t have to worry about whether they know how to code or not.

Of course, a well designed website with bad stock photography can leave a bad impression. So my next recommendation is to use Unsplash to find high quality stock images.


Another great visual communication resource is The Noun Project. Both of these sites will help you find royalty-free photos and icons.

With those three tools you should be able to build a website in less than two hours that looks clean, modern, and professional.

#### Creating your pitch deck

The next asset you’ll likely need to create is a pitch deck. When it comes to designing the pitch deck, don’t reinvent the wheel. Use a Google Slides, Powerpoint, or Keynote template that you can edit slightly as opposed to designing your own from scratch.
