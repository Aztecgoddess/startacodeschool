#### Goal of this chapter

- Learn how to recruit qualified teachers
- Learn how to find a group of volunteers that is large enough to be sustained during vacation periods and unexpected absences

#### Summary of our learnings

- Your school is probably as good as your volunteer teachers
- We advise you to work with professional developers only
- Hire developers that work with the stack you teach
- Try to have your volunteers recruit new mentors
- Create standard documentation that gets your mentors up to speed about teaching

#### Introduction
As a coding school your program is as good as the quality of your teachers, so it’s really important to recruit the best possible teachers that fit your organization's culture. As an organization you will have to offer your volunteer teachers an environment that makes them want to keep coming back. This is essential since the longer volunteers teach, the better they get at it.

#### What motivates our volunteers?

1. They feel that they make significant impact on the lives of our students, without losing their social lives or taking salary cuts (since they teach once a week).

2. They get to know a lot of people that share the same passions (fellow teachers and students) and they get to know a lot of other cultures (our students). This incentive is especially strong amongst ex-pats who live in Amsterdam.

3. They gain skills by teaching their craft, they gain a large network of fellow developers who can help them professionally, and they gain relevant working experience while doing volunteer work.

It’s can be helpful to communicate these benefits when recruiting teachers, although ideally the thought of helping people in need should be enough to volunteer.

#### How we recruit volunteers
When we recruit volunteers, we separate the target audience in two different groups.

1. Expats:We have a large group of expats as teachers in most of our schools. This is a group of people who are often both skilled and have free time to volunteer.

2. Native Developers:(as in born in the country of the project). Native developers are generally speaking a bit more busy than expat volunteers. It can be important to stress the minimal required commitment to this group particularly.

In order to target these groups we use the following channels:

1. Active volunteers are the best recruiters. It’s easier for them to convince a friend or colleague that the work is good, and if you already have strong developers they will likely have friends with similar ability.

2. Meetups and all tech related events around your stack are good places to recruit mentors. Most events don’t mind you talking for 5 minutes to explain your mission and ask for mentors. (meetup.com)

3. Larger companies with a large development team in your area. Often companies are more than willing to have their employees engage employees engage in volunteer work, and can spread the word via internal mails or slack-channels.

4. Getting the media and blogs to cover your school is a good way to raise awareness and find volunteers. In general tech-related media is best, as this is read most by the target audience.

5. Getting friends and volunteers to share your website or blog posts on social media is another good source of recruiting.

6. AngelList is a great place to search for developers by their skillset. You can also create a job for your organization (but if you don’t intend to pay instructors you’ll need to advertise it as a co-founder role and then mention in the job description that it is a volunteer position)

7. Volunteer boards: While there are few volunteer boards dedicated to people who want to use their programming skills, there are some developers actively looking for ways to give back to their community.
